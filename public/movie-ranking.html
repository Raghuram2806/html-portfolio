<h1>The Best Movies According to Raghu</h1>
    <h2>My all-time top 3 movies</h2>
    <hr />
        <h3>Bahubali2</h3>
            <p>I had a lot of emotional moments and it was like I was on a roller-coaster while I was watching it. 
                My husband is indian and he likes watching Telgue movies more than hindi movies and 
                he was telling me to watch this movie and bahubali showed me why he was interested in south indian movies. 
                It was amazing. I can honestly say it was best indian movie I have seen. 
                I was surprised how much I loved this movie and 
                I'm so happy that I watched it and unhappy for all the years I could watch ans I didn't.  
                Feels shame haha. All characters in both parts were great and story was just fab.</p>
        <h3>Salaar</h3>
            <p>In the heart of a die-hard Prabhas fan, there lay a flicker of doubt as I sat down to watch this film, 
                shadowed by the memory of three past movies that hadn't hit the mark: Adipurush, Radhe Shyam, and Saaho. 
                But then, I decided to watch it again, this time leaving all my doubts at the door. 
                What unfolded before my eyes was nothing short of a revelation. 
                "Salaar" isn't just a movie; it's a masterpiece destined to leave a lasting imprint on its audience. 
                Crafted with brilliance by Director Neel and brought to life by an ensemble of extraordinary talent, 
                it stands tall. And Prabhas? He was more than just a star in it; he was a force, 
                effortlessly embodying a role that seemed like it was written in the stars just for him.</p>
        <h3>SVSC</h3>
            <p>I really loved the concept of this film, it is a great family film. 
                Director Srikanth Addala's direction skills were awesome, 
                very impressed by the acting of all the actors. Mahesh Babu and Daggubati Venkatesh are great actors and 
                the movie had an overall great message.</p>
